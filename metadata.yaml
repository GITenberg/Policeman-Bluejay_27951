description: Although it ranks among the most popular and critically acclaimed of
  his fictional works, Frank L. Baum did not publish this delightful story for children
  under his own name--it's one of only a handful of works that were attributed to
  a pseudonym, Laura Bancroft. This tale follows the adventures of a kindhearted bird
  whose job it is to maintain peace and order in the forest.
